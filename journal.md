Through this project I started brainstorming ideas about a web application that users could retrieve information about the history of a specific location. The main idea was to have the application working with geo location, which will give the user snippets of history from a particular place.

The challenge began when I started researching the type of API’s that could be implemented to retrieve every piece of ‘happenings’ in the place where the user could tag or ‘retrieve’ the information.

As I progressed to retrieve information from the TROVE API, I encountered issues throughout the organisation of the information. I planned to potentially implement another API within the code to get more data about specific buildings being built in the past in contrast with the present.

Another setback was to find an API that contained the images of the buildings and align the information with pictures.

### _Collaboration_


- [ ] Through SCRUM model in TRELLO I was assigned the web muckup and a code prototype that had to be submitted to Github
- [ ] The simple approach was taken from an easy format searched in square space which gave me the idea of bringing pictures to showcase my colleagues work and include a link to take the user to the individual website.
- [ ] The collaborative website would be delivered in a grid format for users to navigate easily from a home page.
- [ ] The name of the collaborative website is in tribute to GLAM API’s and digitized data from galleries, libraries, museums, and other arts institutions being united through our brief assignment.

The information presented would be from the date located in the present with information that happened on that day from other periods of time. The novel part of the application is with a title stating, ‘today in the past’.

The interactive part of the website would be easy for the user to read, having a home page with a brief ‘glance through the site’ entry page, and a link about the news with a ‘look in to the past’ link.

### _amalGLAMation BEFORE and AFTER_

As the initial page would already have enough information, the next page would have a return button to go back to the homepage, so it is not confusing for the user to keep digging in other links. ‘dive back through time’.

The idea is mainly to incentivise the user to interact with the application every time that the web visitor is in a different location.

The application would only focus on data retrieved from an API that could display vast information from a certain period. As an example, the API would hold news from the past.

This will give a twist to the website and maintain user engagement, receiving random information from the location.

One of my ideas was to retrieve information from an API focusing on a map, that could have geo-tagging features. However, the viability for the process was too intricate to adapt within the code.

Therefore, a simpler approach to the web application would be to have a geo-location API and a newspaper or journal API where the information would be able to be retrievable easier.

The next challenge was to give sense to the site, and to be easier to understand for the user. Having the two API’s working together location and retrieving information from the ‘current date’.
